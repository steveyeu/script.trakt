###What can be scrobbled?

This plugin will scrobble local media and most remote streaming content. Local content should be played in Kodi library mode and you should use [TVDb](http://thetvdb.com/) (for tv shows) and [TMDb](http://themoviedb.org) (for movies) as your scrapers. TV shows are identified using their TVDb ID. Movies are identified using the IMDb ID. This helps trakt match up the correct show or movie regardless of the title and improves accuracy a lot.

Remote streaming content will scrobble assuming the metadata is correctly set in Kodi. The various streaming plugins need to correctly identify TV episodes and movies with as much metadata as they can for trakt to know what you're watching.
